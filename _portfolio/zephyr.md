An organization doing e-Business needs capabilities to negotiate electronically the parameters of its transactions in order to fully exploit and utilize information as well as communication tools. This project implements a full-fledged model that supports
* Multi-party multi-issue negotiation by using multi-threading
* Concurrent and independent negotiation on difference issues 
* Hierarchical alignment of issues
* Emphasis on an open and dynamic negotiation environment.

I was awarded **Best Student Project Award** and **Gold Medal** for this project by Tata Consultancy Services for my undergraduate research project, out of all the projects in all 14 departments of my school. <br/> Built Using: Java, Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB), JavaServer Faces (JSF), Java Script, JQuery, Glassfish Server, Oracle Database
