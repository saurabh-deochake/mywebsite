A simple python script to fetch winnowed tweets (hence, tweennow) related to a topic/trend and send notifications on to the desktop. No need to visit Twitter every now and then. This project is developed in python with the help of Twitter Developers API. It shows tweets about selected topics/hashtags/location/any search word are shown as popup notifications on the desktop obviating the need of visiting Twitter. Less time wasted on Twitter, more time invested in work as you see tweets in popups.
