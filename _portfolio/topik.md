Increasing popularity of social media platforms and location based services has made it possible to query the data generated by 
social media interactions in novel ways other than traditional search. With advent of Data Science techniques, data scientists 
can delve deep into the data generated by social media and inspect it to find different ways the users interact on social media
and in turn, Internet. In this project, we will make use of data generated by social media interaction for example, tweets, and/or 
geo-tagged instragram photos, and/or facebook posts on a particular topic from a specific region and bring about a top-k Social 
media data(User/Tweets/Posts). Given a location l, in the form of (Latitude,Longitude), distance d, and a set of keywords K, the 
algorithm used in our module will fetch top-k users who have posted media relevant to the desired keyword k *subset* K in a 
proximity to location l(Lat,Long) within distance d. We congregate, analyze and represent the data to end user. Finally, we 
will conduct an experimental study using real social media data sets such as Twitter to evaluate our module in development.

Built Using: Python, Bootstrap, MariaDB
