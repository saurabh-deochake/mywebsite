Evently is a social media bot which helps its user to list all the events using a keyword or a location and find all the friends who will attend that event. This bot uses Facebook's Graph API and Twitter's Streaming API to notify the user if a friend is posting a status/image/video from the location of the event the user is attending. For example, if user of this app, user A is attending an event in New York City then he can check all the events in New York City area and check if any friend is coming to that event. The app will give a notification as soon as it catches A's friend posting about that event from that location of that event on Facebook or Twitter.

Built using: Python, Flask, Graph API, Bootstrap, JavaScript/JQuery, Html, CSS
