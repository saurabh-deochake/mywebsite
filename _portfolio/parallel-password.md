This project explores the possibilities of integrating parallel programming concepts and processing power of Rutgers' ELF cluster to achieve better performance with respect to password cracking. Passphrase cracking can be carried out using dictionary attack. In this project, I used parallel programming concepts like multi-threading using OpenMP to carry out dictionary attack. The project culminates in carrying out benchmark of the project with respect to speedup gained
as opposed to sequential process.
