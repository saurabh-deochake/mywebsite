title: "HENRI: High Efficiency Negotiation-based Robust Interface for Multi-party Multi-issue Negotiation over the Internet"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/henri
excerpt: 'This paper proposes a framework for a full fledged negotiation system that allows multi party multi issue negotiation. It focuses on the negotiation protocol to be observed and provides a platform for concurrent and independent negotiation on individual issues using the concept of multi threading. It depicts the architecture of an agent detailing its components. The paper sets forth a hierarchical pattern for the multiple issues concerning every party. The system also provides enhancements such as the time-to-live counters for every advertisement, refinement of utility considering non-functional attributes, prioritization of issues, by assigning weights to issues.'
