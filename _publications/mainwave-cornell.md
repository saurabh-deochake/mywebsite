title: "MAINWAVE: Multi Agents and Issues Negotiation for Web using Alliance Virtual Engine"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/mainwave-cornell
excerpt: 'This paper showcases an improved architecture for a complete negotiation system that permits multi party multi issue negotiation. The concepts of multithreading and concurrency has been utilized to perform parallel execution. The negotiation history has been implemented that stores all the records of the messages exchanged for every successful and rejected negotiation process and implements the concepts of artificial intelligence in determination of proper weights for a valid negotiation mechanism. The issues are arranged in a hierarchical pattern so as to simplify the representation and priorities are assigned to each issue, which amounts to its relative importance. There is refinement of utilities by consideration of the non-functional attributes. So as to avoid overloading of the system, a maximum number of parties are allowed to participate in the entire mechanism and if more parties arrive, they're put into a waiting queue in accordance to certain criteria such as the first come first serve or the relative priorities. This helps in fault tolerance. It also supports the formation of alliances among the various parties while carrying out a negotiation.'
